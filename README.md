### Hey there! I‚Äôm thrilled to share ChronoCraft.
This is my first full-fledged e-commerce platform for luxury watches‚Äîa passion project I poured my heart into. As someone with a background in IT operations now diving into DevOps, this project was a pivotal step in my growth, giving me a hands-on grasp of the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)‚Äîfrom planning and development to live deployment on AWS.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment & DevOps on AWS

I deployed ChronoCraft live on an AWS EC2 instance, handling every step from scratch with a production-ready mindset:

* **Nginx Configuration:** Set up Nginx as a high-performance reverse proxy, ensuring secure HTTPS traffic and efficient request routing to the Node.js application.
* **Process Management:** Used **PM2** to manage the Node.js runtime, enabling auto-restarts, process monitoring, and high availability.
* **Security & Optimization:** Secured the server with AWS Security Groups, integrated Cloudinary for asset optimization, and implemented backup snapshots.
