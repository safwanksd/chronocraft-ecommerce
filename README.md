### Hey there! I‚Äôm thrilled to share ChronoCraft.
This is my first full-fledged e-commerce platform for luxury watches‚Äîa passion project I poured my heart into. As someone with a background in IT operations now diving into DevOps, this project was a pivotal step in my growth, giving me a hands-on grasp of the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)‚Äîfrom planning and development to live deployment and containerization.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Dynamic Variant Selection:** Switch watch variants by color with real-time image updates, zoom functionality, and stock/price adjustments, powered by JavaScript and Cloudinary.
* **Secure Payment Ecosystem:** Integrated with **Razorpay** for seamless payments, paired with a user wallet system for refund credits, ensuring trust and flexibility.
* **Smart Pricing Engine:** Real-time price breakdowns at checkout with category/product offers and coupons, driven by complex MongoDB queries.
* **Interactive Admin Dashboard:** Features filterable sales charts, top 10 best-sellers, and downloadable PDF/Excel reports using MongoDB aggregation.
* **Smart Inventory Management:** Ensures stock validation during order placement and handles inventory updates on cancellations/returns using MongoDB transactions.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment & DevOps

This project showcases skills in both traditional cloud deployment and modern containerization practices, demonstrating a clear progression of my skills.

#### **1. Original Deployment on AWS**
I initially deployed ChronoCraft live on an AWS EC2 instance, handling every step from scratch to create a production-ready environment:

* **EC2 Setup:** Provisioned an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance.
* **Nginx Configuration:** Set up Nginx as a high-performance reverse proxy.
* **Process Management:** Used **PM2** to manage the Node.js runtime for high availability.
* **Security & Optimization:** Secured the server with AWS Security Groups and integrated Cloudinary for asset optimization.

#### **2. Local Development with Docker**
To create a consistent and reproducible development environment, the entire application has since been containerized:

* A `Dockerfile` provides the blueprint to build a clean, efficient image of the Node.js application.
* A `docker-compose.yml` file defines the entire application stack, including the application service and a MongoDB database service, connected on a private network.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup (with Docker)

To get a local copy up and running, you need **Docker Desktop** installed. This is the recommended way to run the project.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/safwanksd/chronocraft-ecommerce.git](https://github.com/safwanksd/chronocraft-ecommerce.git)
    cd chronocraft-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    * This project requires environment variables for API keys. A template is provided in `.env.example`.
    * Create your own `.env` file by copying the example:
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Now, open the `.env` file and add your actual keys and secrets for services like Google OAuth, Razorpay, and Nodemailer. **You do not need to add a `MONGODB_URI`**, as Docker Compose handles this automatically.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
